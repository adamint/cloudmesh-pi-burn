  To create a cluster from Rasberry Pi's one needs to either use a
  headless setup or burn a number of SDC cards. Typically after the
  burning of SDCards, we are faced with additional setup steps. However
  these steps can be simplified while assuring that the SDCard is
  modified after the burning with ssh enabled, a public key injected,
  a unique hostname assigned, and a network address specified. This
  command is naturally also important in case we need to re-burn a card
  in case a card would become bad or the OS on it for some reason
  corrupted. While attaching a multi-card USB writer it is possible
  to write multiple cards at the time one needs to switch cards into a
  single card writer.
